# 🧑‍💻 Muhammad Shahid – Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This project is not only a part of my learning journey through Coursera's **IBM Back-End JavaScript Developer** Professional Certificate, but it also represents **my own work, skills, and style** as a web developer.

## 🌐 About This Project

This portfolio was built during **Course 2: Introduction to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript** of the IBM JavaScript Developer program on Coursera.

While the project structure follows the course assignment, the content — such as my skills, projects, and personal information — has been fully customized to **reflect my own background, development experience, and creativity**.

I intend to use this portfolio to showcase my skills whenever someone asks:  
> _"Can I see your portfolio?"_

👉 I’ll share this very GitHub link, because it represents **my work**.
